# üá∫üáø Uzbek Sentiment Analysis Web App

A professional web application built with Flask for sentiment analysis of Uzbek-language text. The app seamlessly translates user input from Uzbek to English in the background, classifies the sentiment using a multilingual BERT model, and returns the result as either **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**. The frontend is styled with Bootstrap 5 for a clean and responsive user experience.

## üß† How It Works

1. The user enters a sentence in Uzbek.
2. The backend translates it into English using Google Translate.
3. The translated text is passed into a pre-trained multilingual BERT model.
4. The model predicts a sentiment score from 1 to 5:

   * **1‚Äì2:** Negative
   * **3:** Neutral
   * **4‚Äì5:** Positive
5. The app renders the result with visual labels (badges).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

* Internet access is required for translation and model inference.
* Translation is backend-only and not visible to users.
* Python 3.13 compatibility is ensured via `deep-translator`, avoiding deprecated modules.

## üå± Future Improvements

* ‚úÖ Telegram bot integration
* üìä Sentiment trend analytics and history logging
* üß© REST API support for external integrations
* üö¢ Dockerized deployment option
